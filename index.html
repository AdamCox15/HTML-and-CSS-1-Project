    <h2>Kirill Kaprizov</h2>
    <p>Kirill Kaprizov made an immediate impact for the Minnesota Wild when he had two assists and then scored in overtime in his NHL debut, a 4-3 win against the Los Angeles Kings on Jan. 14, 2021. The forward became the first player in NHL history with three points, including an overtime goal, in his first game. He scored his 37th point April 19 to break Marian Gaborik's Wild rookie record of 36 points set in 2000-01. Kaprizov led NHL rookies in goals (27), points (51), power-play goals (eight) and shots on goal (157) in 55 games and won the Calder Trophy voted as NHL rookie of the year. The following season he scored 47 goals to break the Wild single-season record of 42 previously owned by Marian Gaborik (2007-08) and Eric Staal (2017-18) and became the first player in Wild history to score 100 points in one season (108). He also helped Minnesota set team records for most wins (53) and points (113). The forward was chosen by the Wild in the fifth round (No. 135) of the 2015 NHL Draft.</p>

    <h2>Alex Ovechkin</h2>
    <p>In the end, the highly prized and touted Ovechkin went No. 1 overall to the Washington Capitals in the 2004 NHL Draft.Forced to miss a year due to the league's season-long lockout, Ovechkin made his NHL debut with a bang in October 2005, potting two goals in just four minutes and checking an opponent so hard that he broke the glass partition. He went on to net 52 goals and register 54 assists that season (2005-06), winning the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's Rookie of the Year. In the years since, the Russian superstar has only stepped up his dominance to become one of the NHL's most explosive and feared scorers. During the 2007-08 season, Ovechkin scored 65 times and dished out 47 assists to capture his first Hart Trophy as the league's MVP. The following season, Ovechkin won the Hart for the second (consecutive) time. He earned a third MVP honor following the 2012-13 season.</p>
